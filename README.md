**horribleAttention**

- **Project:** A small experimental collection exploring attention mechanisms, demos, and tooling.
- **Purpose:** Fast, hacky prototypes and visualizations for attention-related ideas — not production-ready.

**Highlights**
- **Interactive demo:** A Streamlit demo is included to visualize and play with attention components.
- **Standalone visualization:** `attention.html` contains a static demo you can open in a browser.
- **Multi-language examples:** Contains small Python and C++ experiments (`main.py`, `main.cc`).

**Quick Start**
- Install Python dependencies (recommended):

```
pip install -r requirements-streamlit.txt
```

- Run the Streamlit demo:

```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

- Or open the static demo: open `attention.html` in your browser.

**Repository Layout**
- **attention.html:** Static attention visualization/demo.
- **streamlit_app.py:** Streamlit demo UI and examples.

**Goals & Philosophy**
- Keep experiments simple, educational, and easy to modify.
- Prefer clarity and quick iteration over optimization or robustness.

**Contributing**
- Bug reports, small improvements, and reproducible examples are welcome. Create issues or PRs.

**License**
- Check the repository for an existing license file. If none exists, assume permissive personal-use intentions and ask the maintainer for clarification.

**Contact**
- If you want help extending these demos or turning parts into a cleaner library, open an issue or reach out in the repo.
